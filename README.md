# Hangman-Game
This idea was taken from: https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-projects/

- [x] Two/Four Players
- [ ] One Player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence
- [ ] The others suggest letters within a certain number of guesses
- [ ] The word to guess is represented by a row of <b>dashes</b>, representing each <b>letter</b> of the <b>word</b>
- [ ] If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other players writes it in all its correct positions
- [ ] If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other players draws one element of a hanged man <b>stick figure</b> as a <b>tally mark</b>
- [ ] The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.
- [ ] If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser win. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram.
- [ ] If the other player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing.
- [ ] The guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the world, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
